            name: "vs War & Hpal",
            text: "The strategy for this fight is to camp your priest at a pillar such as a Nagrand pillar, Dalaran Sewer Box, or the large Blade's Edge pillars. It is often much harder to win on Ruins of Lordaeron. \n"
            +"You want to pressure the Hpal by dragging the warrior line of sight of them, which forces them to use mana inefficiently on Holy Shocks/cleansing Chains to help the warrior stay offensive. Look for dispels on Beacons & Divine Pleas, but it's typically more important to keep the Warrior out of paladin's LOS than chase the paladin for dispels. \n"
            +"The key abilities you play around are your Death Grip and Psychic Screams. I advise that you save Death Grip to be available as a peel if the warrior has Bladestorm available, as Freedom -> Bladestorm can be quite rough on your priest's mana and cooldowns. While bladestorm is on CD, you can usually play around using Grip and Psychic Scream on the hpal on cooldown to pressure them or set up a kill window. \n"
            +"Priest should be dispelling Freedom's on the warrior as soon as possible so they can be peeled with chains/desecration. When priest is free/healthy look for the grip -> fear swaps on paladin. You can also pressure the warrior together if he plays too aggressively around pillars and the priest is able to dispel Sacred Shield. \n"
            +"<hr> Ground Rules: \n"
            +"1. Don't leave your disc priest alone with the warrior for too long. You can swap to the paladin with some frequency, but not in a scenario in which the warrior would be able to tee off on your disc priest. \n"
            +"2. Priest should avoid leaving the pillar. Priest should focus on kiting away from the warrior as much as possible and allowing MS to fall. Trying to stand and tank the warrior will oom them very quickly for little benefit. \n"
            +"3. Priest should spec reflective shield. \n"

            name: "vs Feral & Disc",
            text: "The strategy for this fight is to murder the enemy priest as efficiently & quickly as possible. You need your priest to assist you in killing the enemy priest with his Shadowfiend, Offensive Dispels, Devouring Plague, and Abolish Disease on you to keep you mobile. Your priest should also consider using offensive dispels on the feral in order to purge off his Predator's Swiftness procs. I usually wouldn't bother going for mana burns. \n"
            +"It is unlikely that you will be able to kill the enemy priest in the opener through the feral's peels/counterpressure, but you should be able to consistently force major cooldowns such as Desperate Prayer and Pain Suppression with your gargoyle and help from your priest. Your priest can save their Shadowfiend for a 2nd major push on the enemy priest who is out of CDs which should hopefully be fatal. \n"
            +"You need to save and use your defensive CDs such as IBF and AMS to block peels by the feral during your go's. Your priest can start to push in for a double fears after the Feral's Berserk is over. Try to force major CDs from the priest ASAP, and turn to face the feral as much as possible during his Berserk without putting diseases on them to reduce counterpressure. \n"
            +"<hr> Ground Rules: \n"
            +"1. Do NOT allow POM to bounce by damaging/dotting the feral. Stick to Blood Strikes so you don't accidentally cleave.  \n"
            +"2. Presume you have about a 2 minute time limit; you can still win games which go longer, but you are less likely to win as the game drags on \n"
            +"3. Use your Trinket, AMS, and IBF offensively (AMS Predator's swiftness procs, IBF when you sense an incoming Bash peel) \n"
            +"4. Don't try to play the mana game, even with a quick dispel on Innervate you may still be at a disadvantage, and good teams will always outlast you. \n"

            name: "vs Rogue & Enhance",
            text: "For this comp the main focus is to not allow the enhance and rogue to connect on your priest together. I typically like to open with my pet macro/rocket to become unsappable/enter combat, and start with a strang on the enhance to prevent him from using shammy rage on your opening burst. You can also gnaw him during his sprint (first 5 seconds of wolves), as he cannot trinket this without being vulnerable to a full fear including his wolves. If you can get Garg off in strang/gnaw and prevent their rush on your priest, you can grip the enhance across the map and chains spam him to prevent him from connecting again. Your priest can help with damage by using devouring plague and fiend during his ps to add significant pressure, and they should go down. If enhance kites you to recover can simply swap to the rogue and murder/peel him. \n"
            +"Good teams will likely try to peel you early with cheapshot/gouge to enable the shaman to connect, but you can counter this with grip gnaw into strang while the priest runs los and 1v1s the rogue. \n"

            name: "vs DK & Hpal",
            text: "This is an extremely tough matchup against equivalent opponents, it's basically a harder version of wopal as the dk can't be killed as easily, does equal burst pressure and more mana pressure vs your priest and can amz the hpala defensively even if he would otherwise be cooked. \n"
            +"The matchup plays very similar to wopal, but one difference is you will want to kill his gargo asap and amz the strang if possible, to prevent the dk from ooming your priest too quickly or killing him. You also have the advantage of being able to freely chains the dk, while he is limited in his snares on you due to being forced to bounce pom. I would typically look for setups on the hpala when he uses freedom on the dk, with a grip fear. You are time limited and a good dk will never let you drink, so your best shot is to peel aggressively early then hit the gas the remainder of the game; trying to outlast them plays in their favor. Darius style 3.1 also has some nice bonus damage as an option which may tip the scale, as you can cleave both the dk and the hpal and dispel his beacons inside of grip/fear gos, forcing him to use plea often/early and become vulnerable to your counterpressure or even potentially ooming. \n"
            +"Your priest may consider swapping pillars often as desecration mostly works against you, and you have the option to grip chains the dk behind pillars to peel/ams his swap which will give your priest some space to cross and recover more freely while just spam dispelling any chains he throws. \n"

        {
            name: "vs Rogue & Disc",
            text: "This is a very interesting matchup, it used to be somewhat unwinnable at high levels, but I believe with specific talents one of their biggest counter plays which guaranteed them a strong opener (cheapshot gouge shiv crippling on the dk) is not quite as effective. \n"
            +"In s6 especially with the major damage boosts we got against cloth from 252 weapon, I prefer  to just train down the priest. Your priest can heavily assist you by throwing a fiend and devouring plague on the enemy disc after pain suppression, as well as throwing a few dispels on the enemy priest if possible. \n"
            +"The main win condition here is not allowing them to both connect on your priest while you're cc'ed, and if you can connect on their priest with yours, even briefly, it becomes too much. Your priest should focus on staying line of sight of the enemy priest unless you are able to land a gnaw/strang on the priest and crank up the counterpressure without your priest falling behind or simply flopping to the enemy priest. \n"
            +"Avoid putting chains on the rogue as you can't stop vanish sprint and cloak go's regardless and will just bounce pom \n"
            +"If rogue is mutilate or tunneling you the entire game, you can ams off his crippling poison and kite him out with chains, then intermittently grip the enemy priest into los of yours for burns with a gnaw/chains spam, even if they avoid this they will eventually just rot and oom to dispelling chains/damage \n"
