            text: "When fighting against enemy disc priests, their biggest weakness is their inability to handle being trained mercilessly; they have very strong abilities on relatively short cooldowns, such as Psychic Scream and Power Word: Shield's, but in-between the windows of these abilities, they are very vulnerable and need help via peeling by their partners. If you let the game go long, you will have to push through extra fears/shields, and with no mortal strike/limited interrupts, the priest will be able to top himself consistently. \n"
            +"To counteract this, DK/Preg can aggressively rotate their defensive cooldowns and CC breaks to limit the duration of the game. This includes bubbling cc and immediately canceling it to stay as aggressive as possible. The Preg has the ability to freedom stuns, and use their Sacrifices to avoid CC like Blind/Sap. The DK comes with a trinket, ability to avoid sap with pet-psuedo combat, and trinket/ams/lichborne for Blind/Fears. \n"
            +"The name of the game is to blow everything early to maintain momentum on the priest; he has no freedom so he can be caught easily with a grip into a desecration snare to keep him immobile. My standard opener includes a dual push with the preg, who uses Divine Sacrifice while I dismount halfway across the map and send Ghoul @ priest to become un-sappable. Usually I can connect on the priest by gnawing them with a pincer movement if they are trying to stay 180 degrees on the pillar. \n"
            +"Pre-ibfing the rogue opener is usually a good policy, the only unavoidable peels he has for you include Crippling Poison, Waylay, Dismantle, Blind, and Gouge; all of which can be helped with by either Freedom or a BOP from the preg. \n"
            +"It is most important to allow the DK to connect on the priest; the Preg alone will not be able to force anything meaningful from the priest, I suggest your opening stun order to be Gnaw -> HoJ so it guarantees the priest sits a 3 second stun; if you HoJ first he will just trinket and Gnaw will be only 1.5 seconds due to Diminishing Returns. Rep can be used to harass/disrupt the rogue, or can be used as an interrupt on priest/temporary CC to allow you both to connect and set up on the priest if you flush him out into LOS of the Preg \n"
            +"Using your immunities and the preg assistance with things like Freedoms/BoPs/Cleanses on you, you should be able to stay aggressive on the priest while soaking up damage from the rogue opener. I suggest you consider using bubble early on and either sitting inside of it during Pain Suppression/focusing on keeping the DK healthy/mobile, or canceling it immediately to stay aggressive. Don't do this before the rogue has used dance, or the rogue will simply hard swap to the Preg and murder him. Once the rogue has committed dance, usually on the DK, the Preg is free to bubble/cancel a cc such as Blind/Fear. The early bubble will enable the Preg to use Wings sooner if the game drags a bit too long. I would try to keep matches within a 1 minute time limit. \n"
            +"If the DK is enabled to stay offensive on the priest and you limit how many new shields/fears the priest is able to utilize, you can simply ride the priest out start to finish through peels. They won't make it easy on you, but once you get the concept down and the synergy to execute it with your Preg, you will find great success with this strategy, whereas you might struggle going for a slower approach and slowly getting rotted down by the rogue's dances + priests offensives/cc \n"
            +"I like to use Strangulate on the priest as my Preg initially connects, to delay/prevent the immediate double-fear and allow the Preg to unleash his damage abilities before getting immediately CCed \n"
            +"*Ground Rules:* \n"
            +"1. Don't dot the rogue at all or you will bounce POM. There is no reason to touch him unless the priest is handing you an opening by playing too far away/conservatively \n"
            +"2. Presume a 1 minute time limit and try to end the game within that; chain all your defensive cooldowns together in order to stay mobile and aggressive \n"
            +"3. Don't be afraid to blow cooldowns pre-emptively or for 'unequal' trades; such as early bubble for fear, ultimately this matchup is a math problem and if you have more immunities/cc breaks than they have peels and you're using them in the correct order, the game is yours to win. That doesn't mean things will always go smoothly and you will have to adapt in the moment and exploit the opportunities your opponents give you. \n"

            text: "This is a nightmare comp/matchup that I still have not completely solved yet, but I expect will be quite winnable in s6 gear. Good teams will usually try to camp open field making it impossible to connect on either target without getting teed off on by the ele. There are a few options to try, but nothing is guaranteed as the ele can disrupt your go's easily with knock/root or help tank them with offhealing on hoj. \n"
            +"A good generic go might include hitting the ele a bit, ideally to get the pala to sacred the ele, then looking for a swap on hpal with grip -> rep. If the shaman is low enough you may force a trinket or some other defensive, but you should mostly be looking for the hoj/strang/gnaw go on the hpal after the rep, ideally with no sacred shield. If the go fails or you force trink/bubble, you can recover on pillar and peel/death strike the ele. I managed to stalemate it for quite a while versus a decent team, but I feel they have the advantage overall and a much simpler win condition. You may also find some success tunneling the ele, he is vulnerable to kills/forcing cooldowns if stoneclaw/ebind get wasted and you can cc the hpal in the window. \n"

Something like dalaran sewers it might be tempting to tunnel the spriest, but it is likely he is able to make it to the boxes with mage peels and fully recover while your cds tick away. I have found general success simply tunneling the mage in order to stop/limit his polys on the preg, you can also kill the mage in between his first and 2nd block (30s window), or force him to kite away for an evo and enable a swap on the spriest. Whatever you decide to do, don't hit them both at the same time or you won't have enough damage to kill either and will bounce poms. Your preg must also be informed that he is the support plebeian and not the hero of the comp, and should mostly be focused on avoiding deep/cs into polys while keeping you clean of debuffs and mobile \n"

If you try to tunnel the mage the priest will be able to keep them up and will eventually start ruining you, if you lose pressure on the priest the mage will swap from peel mode to kill mode and destroy one of you, so I am typically hitting the gas start to finish. The preg should be nearby in order to support/avoid poly with big sac, but should be close to los and shouldn't be pushing on the disc unless he doesn't have fear available \n"

            text: "Very similar fight to disc priest mage, hunter has many roots and peels but is more capable of bursting you down with mortal strike and readiness bursts. I prefer to ride out the priest start to finish with my preg, with freedom on me for roots, time bop/pet sac on a fresh aimed shot, ideally with pin or entrapment/silence shot, and use every cd from the preg to stay offensive and from the dk to soak damage; try to ams his chimera as soon as you see serpent sting, time strang on a broken shield + when preg is connecting so he can get damage off before fear \n"

            text: "This is a very similar matchup to the dk hpal version, or dk preg vs spriest mage. Ultimately it's two casters vs a dk with a pala behind him to keep him mobile and aggressive. Personally I prefer to run down the ele shaman using all my cds, with a rep hoj on the warlock by the preg. Preg can also bubble offensively early as they are forced to peel you with damage but will focus on peeling him with cc. If he chains an early bubble + dispel spam into big sac and freedom on you, you should freely connect on the ele shaman. Try to avoid the roots from the shaman with an early ams, freedom the next set of roots you can't avoid, and trinket the death coil to not let the shaman have any room to breathe and recover. If you keep them on the back foot they will eventually flop unless you get baited into a z axis knock, but gargo should still be hammering them and you can disrupt his recovery with a strang/gnaw while you get back up to him. \n"

            text: "This matchup is hard to quantify, as your action/reactions somewhat depend on the other teams decisions. Typically I like to grip strang the enemy preg in the opener and start aggressively, especially as Horde and on NA. On EU/Alliance I have had more success with saving Strangulate for after the enemy Preg's bubble. You will need to AMS their early repentance if you don't open with Strang. \n"
            +"The main tricks to this comp are how well you are able to kite the preg if he's hitting you for procs, or stay on top of him if he's kiting you around the pillar. You should also be very cognizant of when and how and when to use your gnaws and amz from the dk pov. Ultimately it's a bit of a rng and a bit of a mechanical superiority test which determines the outcome, but I ain't giving you people all of my bag o tricks cause I have to fight your asses all season too \n"

            text: "This is a really fun matchup overall, especially since DK teams near universally struggle vs this comp. The dk and preg have many viable paths to victory, but the ease of execution depends on the skill/playstyle of your opponents. \n"
            +"For hyper aggressive warriors, it may be simpler to drag and kite him around pillar while threatening rep on the hpal to bait out his sacrifice. Best time to rep the hpal is after divine sacrifice is used and he puts freedom on the warrior. You can full hoj the warrior after you force his trinket, which is usually possible to bait out with a gnaw on freedom synergized with a rep/hoj on pala. \n"
            +"After you can force trinket from the warrior, he is vulnerable to a kill inside of a full hoj later, especially if it is protected by 5 stacks of seal vengeance/chains. Send this go after the pala uses his hand of sacrifice, preferably on the warriors freedom; so they will not be able to mitigate damage on the war between holy shocks/break out of rep without using bubble immediately \n"
            +"You can also kill the paladin with a grip HoJ go, if the paladin sacs your opening repentance and uses freedom/sacred shield on the warrior, look for a swap on him and you may be able to force a trink with a simple hoj go, or bubble with hoj strang if he sits it \n"
            +"If the warrior and pala play too passively, you may be able to oom them or simply rot through their cooldowns over time then kill in a wings/hoj when pala has no bubble \n"

            +"I haven't solved all iterations of this comp, but glyph of turn evil is a strong tool against both the succubus and the felpup pets. Vs rshaman and rdruid it is likely good policy to repentance the lock and turn evil the pet for your go's. \n"
            +"Vs a shaman I prefer to tunnel the shaman down all in one go; the preg can sit bubble and apply red/judge and his venge stacks; my defensive/anti cc rotation is typically ams into ibf + lichborne with trink available for hex or death coils, also saving amz for pala after bubble is nice \n"
            +"Vs a Druid it is a bit trickier, and I honestly don't have much experience with fighting it. However you can be quite successful with forcing/baiting skin in a go, recovering a bit, and killing Druid with no trinket/skin in a grip/strang \n"
            +"Vs hpal lock I think it is generally a counter, but you may find some success either setting up go's on the hpal with grip hoj, or the preg plays back while you hit the lock/pet and kick fire to limit pressure/gnaw health funnels and fears as needed \n"

In late s6 and with some creative gearing it may also be possible to oom them by dragging the feral los and avoiding fears on the preg from the priest with rep/hoj threat \n"
            +"To tunnel the disc down, it is important to avoid the pounce as the feral can come close to killing you in it; pala should be ready to freedom it immediately as a backup. I like to start with chains ibf on priest, if you can connect him before the feral it's very good as you have freedom available for bash/bear root. Your preg should be using his cooldowns offensively - to keep you on the priest and under minimal pressure. Be careful with the order, it is often more efficient to bubble sooner than later due to the threat of Cyclone (which can only be trinketted). \n"

            +"**Alternative:** \n"
            +"This matchup is real pain in ass for DK & Preg, any disc comp with a lot of peels for disc is big banana for us. They have Cyclones, off heal, stuns, fear... all those things we gotta watch, dont overlap defensive cooldowns, trade them properly (IBF and DSAC). There are two ways how to beat it: \n"
            +"1. Go yolo on priest (wait on pillar, when priest pushes like middle of the way, then you go out of the pillar and catch him open, so you can grip him back with after you pop gargoyle and it has more uptime on him). When feral go out of form (mostly offheal or hardcast Cyclone), then use repentance on him, that should waste priest GCD or feral trinket. Priest is most likely dead, try to not get baited with kick, thats your only way to kill him. Track shield, let the dk always break it and dont use judgement on it. \n"
            +"2. Less yolo and more consistent approach: Hit feral always, be aware of double fears, kite him as much as you can, try to rep priest and hoj him aswell, use gnaw on feral and try to pump him, repeat it every repentance CD. The importan part is kiting an double fear. If feral is sitting DK, then you have to be in frost presence with devo aura. On every Cyclone on preg, DK runs away and grip priest off him, so he doesn't get feared \n\n"
            +"---\n"
            +"Simply put: \n"
            +"- 1st way: \n"
            +"\t - Go yolo priest, catch him open, grip back open with all offensive CDs \n"
            +"\t - Don't get baited with kick, thats the most important thing to land, while doing this tactic \n"
            +"\t - Try to Repentance feral when he is out of form \n"
            +"- 2nd way: \n"
            +"\t - Hit feral, kite him as much as you can \n"
